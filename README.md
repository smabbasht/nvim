# ðŸ’¤ smabbasht - LazyVim

This is my configuration on top of NvChad since I got tired of having to
maintain the core config myself and my config for lazyVim started fighting me back. 
Now, I just have to align certain cherries on top of the distributed nvim config while porting all my keymaps that I had previous.

My config is mainly crafted for my day job and hobbies, so it includes support
for following languages:
- Scala
- Rust
- Python

And following features:
- Debugging
- Enhanced tree-sitter objects for coding
- Harpoon for easy switching to files
- Tmux navigation
